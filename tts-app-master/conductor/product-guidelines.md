# Product Guidelines - Communication Assistant

## Tone and Voice
- **Context-Aware Profiles:** The application must support multiple communication profiles (e.g., Formal, Casual, Urgent) that adjust the voice output's prosody and the selection of suggested phrases.
- **Clarity First:** Regardless of the tone, all voice output must prioritize high intelligibility and natural-sounding synthesis.

## User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
- **High Accessibility:** The UI must employ high-contrast color schemes and large, easily tappable targets to accommodate use in diverse environments and potential physical fatigue.
- **Real-Time Responsiveness:** The interface must provide immediate visual feedback for all inputs, especially gesture and sign language recognition, to ensure the user feels in control.

## Translation Integration
- **Persistent Translation (Subtitles):** When enabled, translations should appear as persistent "subtitles" directly beneath the primary text output to allow both the user and the communication partner to follow along effortlessly.

## Privacy and Data Security
- **On-Device Sovereignty:** By default, all conversation logs and personal phrase libraries are stored locally on the device using strong encryption. No data is transmitted to external servers without explicit user consent.
