# Initial Concept

i am non-verbal because of a complete laryngectomy. i would like to build an iOS app to help me communicate with different people in various situations. i've been using existing text-to-speech apps but have not been satisfied with their limitations. i would like to use this mainly for irl person-to-person communication. my input could be typing on the screen, capturing hand gestures for typing, and/or capturing sign language. the output should be text or voice. one key feature is to log the conversation as it happens and make the history accessible later. also, there should be saved/favorite phrases that are easily accessible and customizable. finally, the output should be translated into different languages
